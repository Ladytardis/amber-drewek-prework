            <p>To start with you should probably know that I am a nerd.  I don't really hide it at all but occasionally I
                talk to somone that hasn't heard and then suddenly they get a little concerned when I mention that I'm trying
                to learn Klingon or that I've been to conventions.  It is kind of a hoot when it happens.  Like in college when everyone thought I was 12.
                I shouldn't enjoy upseting peoples perceptions but after the third time in your 20's that you get a childrens menu it it kind of funny.
                So, disclaimer, I am actually an adult even if I enjoy making cosutumes in my spare time.

            <P>While a lot of my hobbys are indoors, I do also enjoy the outdoors as well.  
                When I was 9 I wanted to be a nature photographer and travel around hiking to get that perfect shot.  
                Obviously that has changed somewhat with age.  
                But I do still enjoy going out and hiking and getting some fun images while I'm out.
                I did rockclimbing as a kid and that also stuck with me, though now days its more bouldering.
                One of the reasons I love living in the Midwest is that we have so many fun and cool things to do outside, and it changes so often.  The same hike is entirely different in winter as summer, and it changes weekly in the spring.
            </P>

            <p>While most of my crafts are nerd themed they actually started fairly normally.  My Grandma was a huge textile worker, she did pretty much everything: several kinds of embroidery, knitting, crochet, tatting, sewing....  
                She taught my mom who passed it on to me, and I loved it.
                My Grandpa on the other hand was a rock hound so I learned beading and lapidary from him.
                Now that I'm coming more into my own and that I have the internet to learn, I've started experimenting a bit with some other creative elements.
                Most recently it turned into chain maile, some simple patterns and then because I have no chill i made a scale maile vest.  
                It took a bit, and I had to fix some of the early parts, but I find jumping into things is the best way to learn.  
                It's immersive, you can learn from your mistakes and then actually implement the solutions right away.  
                Plus by the time you're done you've done it correctly for long enough that it becomes second nature.
                Knowing how to do it right the first time is great, but I find learning how to fix it when it goes wrong can give a deeper understanding of the whole process.
